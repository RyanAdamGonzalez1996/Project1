# Vehicle Make Observable Trends
Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Ford, in that order, have the highest amount of traffic violations. These are also some of the most common vehicle makes out there. So it is not entirely clear that this is due to the vehicle's make, or just the over abundance of these vehicles that skews the results.
The data is statistically significant, so the null hypothesis is no longer in play. Indicating there are factors, that are not due to randomness, that are causing this trend. 
Further Analysis will be needed to see what factor is exactly at work here.
