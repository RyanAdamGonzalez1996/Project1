# Project1 - 404: Group Name Not Found

404 Group Name Not Found - Project 1 – Proposal

Summary:We will be reviewing NYC Parking Violations dataset for the fiscal year 2016.Intent/Inspiration: Best way to avoid getting parking tickets in NYC in the month of Dec.

Questions to be answered:
To determine if there is a correlation between:
Vehicle make & violation code – count of violations assigned
Vehicle color
Vehicle body type & violation code
Plate Type

Dataset Source:https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-parking-tickets
We will be looking at Parkingtickets_Dec2016.csv


# Vehicle Make Observable Trends
Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Ford, in that order, have the highest amount of traffic violations. These are also some of the most common vehicle makes out there. So it is not entirely clear that this is due to the vehicle's make, or just the over abundance of these vehicles that skews the results.
The data is statistically significant, so the null hypothesis is no longer in play. Indicating there are factors, that are not due to randomness, that are causing this trend. 
Further Analysis will be needed to see what factor is exactly at work here.

With the data given, We can see that Toyotas, Hondas, and Nissans are all around 3 times (give or take) more likely to get a traffic violation than the other makes.

The "Other" Section, which is comprised of around 100 different makes, just barely doubles the expected amount of traffic violations. This is showing, that despite the sheer amount of different makes, the number of violations given to each is on average, 29 violations, way below the expected.

# Vehicle Color Observable Trends
Gray and silver vehicles’ violations each differed significantly from their expected totals, but their combined totals more closely match their expected combined totals
Grays and silvers may be used interchangeably by police officers writing tickets
Black vehicles were penalized 30 percent more likely than expected
Black vehicles could make up a larger portion of the NYC car population, or they could receive more violations relative to other cars
Yellow vehicles were penalized three times as often as expected
New York City’s yellow taxis (0.6% of NYC car population)  appear to receive more violations relative to other cars

# Plate Type Observations
There are 37 plate types in the NYC parking tickets data. 
The plate types which received the majority of the violation tickets are
PAS - Passenger (72.1%)
COM- Commercial (13.5%)                                           
OMT- Taxi (8.6%)
OMS- Rental (2.2%)
SRF- Specific Passenger Vanity (1.1%)

#  Vehicle Body Type Observations
Suburban vehicle body type had the most violations. Buses and taxis had lower or insignificant violation counts.
Critical value=15.50
Chi square value=50200.76
Since chi square value is higher than critical value, the results are significant.
